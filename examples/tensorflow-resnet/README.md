# Introduction

This is a Gravity Cluster Image example using the TensorFlow ResNet (Deep Residual Network) server helm chart (2.0.13) that serves a machine learning (ML) model.  The default model is 
for image classification.  The model is pulled from a public URL specified in the [values.yml](./resources/charts/tensorflow-resnet/values.yml)
and can be configured to other models.  See the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) website for more information on using ResNet models.

# Example input and output

The TensorFlow ResNet model has 1000 classifications for living creatures and objects.  Here is an example Ostrich graphic image the model will process and provide a tensor classification for.

## Building Cluster Image
To construct the Tensorflow-ResNet Cluster Image with a dependency-free .tar file use this command.  You can then deploy the Tensorflow-ResNet as a self-contained, truly portable application for your preferred infrastructure. 
```bash
tele build -o tensorflowresnet.tar tensorflow-resnet/resources/app.yaml
```

Further details on installing Gravity Cluster Images is available [here](https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/installation/). 


## Building Application
In addition to Cluster Images, Gravity supports packaging application helm charts as self-contained application images. The application is then deployable in the same manner as helm charts to Gravity clusters. Further information on application packaging deployment is available [here](https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/catalog/).
```bash
tele build -o tensorflowresnet.tar tensorflow-resnet/resources/charts/tensorflow-resnet
```

## Deployment Configuration

The TensorFlow-ResNet application uses the container port 8500 which is available as NodePort of 30090 by default. 
The port is used for client image classification requests. After deploying you will see the following Pod status of initializing while the model is loaded.

```bash
$ kubectl get po
NAME                                READY   STATUS            RESTARTS   AGE                                                                                                                                                              
tensorflow-resnet-bf8f6f5b6-22pgd   0/1     PodInitializing   0          7s                                                                                                                                                               
tensorflow-resnet-bf8f6f5b6-59fq8   0/1     PodInitializing   0          7s                                                                                                                                                               
tensorflow-resnet-bf8f6f5b6-qbd6v   0/1     PodInitializing   0          7s    
```

Once the model is loaded these pods are available to serve image classifications.
```bash
kubectl get po

# Image classification

Image classification requests should be done on a machine with Docker installed. Take note of one of the server's available IPs and confirm the available NodePort.  By default it should be 30090. After invoking you will receive a result tensor.  
The [./tensorClientResources/class.json](./tensorClientResources/class.json) has an array with the names of the results. Note that the classification in the JSON file is one number less then the result.  For example if you gave an image of a hammerhead shark you would
receive the number 5 tensor result which is number 4 below.

```json
{  
  "4": [
    "n01494475",
    "hammerhead"
  ],
  "5": [
    "n01496331",
    "electric_ray"
  ]
  }
```

A convenience script is provided to map the classification number to an English description  See the example below.


## Invoking classification

Two example invocations are shown here.  First invoking a local image with a volume mount and the second is with an image from a public URL.

### Image Classification from Local File

Example local image client invocation on myserver1 with nodeport 30090. Substitute `myserver1` with the address or hostname of your server.

```bash
$ docker run -v $(pwd)/sampleImages/:/sampleImages/  --rm -it bitnami/tensorflow-resnet bash -c "resnet_client_cc --server_port=myserver1:30090 --image_file=/sampleImages/ostrich.jpg"

### Image Classification from Public URL

Invoking a public URL on  myserver1 with nodeport 30090. Substitute `myserver1` with the IP or reachable hostname.
