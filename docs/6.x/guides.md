# Gravity Guides

We have learned quite a few Kubernetes tricks while helping our customers adopt
this technology, and we've been blogging and creating tutorials about it along the way.

## Workshops

We have created a number of workshops for Docker, Kubernetes and Gravity which can be found in this [Github Repo](https://github.com/gravitational/workshop). They include:

* [Docker 101 workshop](docker.md)
* [Kubernetes 101 workshop using Minikube and Mattermost](k8s101.md)
* [Kubernetes production patterns](k8sprod.md)
* [Gravity 101](gravity101.md)
* [Gravity fire drill exercises](firedrills.md)
