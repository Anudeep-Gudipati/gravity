# Gravity Guides

We have learned quite a few Kubernetes tricks while helping our customers adopt
this technology, and we've been blogging and creating tutorials about it along the way.

## Workshops

We have created a number of workshops for Docker, Kubernetes and Gravity which can be found in this [Github Repo](https://github.com/gravitational/workshop). They include:

* [Docker 101 workshop](https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/docker.md#docker-101)
* [Kubernetes 101 workshop using Minikube and Mattermost](https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/k8s101.md#kubernetes-101)
* [Kubernetes production patterns](https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/k8sprod.md#kubernetes-production-patterns)
* [Gravity 101](https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/gravity101.md#gravity-101)
* [Gravity fire drill exercises](https://github.com/gravitational/workshop/blob/master/firedrills.md)
